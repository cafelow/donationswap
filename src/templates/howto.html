		<h1>How EA Donation Swap works</h1>
		<p>By matching donors in countries with few tax deductible EA charities to donors in countries with many, we can keep more money in EAs pockets (and in the pockets of their favored charities!)</p>
		<p>The EA Donation Swap works by putting EAs in contact who can help each other. No money passes through the system directly, and all final decisions are yours to make.</p>

		<p></p>
		
		<img alt="Ava from Animalia" src="/static/ava.png" style="width:224px;height:302px;">
		<p>Ava from the country of Animalia wishes to donate 5000 USD to the Good Food Institute.
						But currently the Good Food Institute is not tax deductible in Animalia, so if she directly donates she doesn’t get tax back at the end of the year.
						The Against Malaria Foundation is tax deductible in Animalia.</p>
		<p></p>
		<img alt="Buzz from Protozania" src="/static/buzz.png" style="width:236px;height:302px;">
		<p>Buzz from the country of Protozania wishes to donate 6000 USD to the Against Malaria Foundation.
						Both the Good Food Institute and the Against Malaria Foundation are tax deductible in Protozania.</p>
		<p></p>

		<p>Ava and Buzz each go onto the donation swap website and enter the details of their country, favored charities and how much they would like to donate.
		After a short wait, they are matched. They both receive an email from <a href="/">donationswap.eahub.org</a> which will let them know each other's email addresses, how much to donate (in their local currency), what charity to donate to, and the best way to donate to minimise transfer costs.</p>
		<p>Ava and Buzz communicate over email and agree to move forward with the swap.</p>
		<p>Ava donates 5000 USD to the Against Malaria Foundation on behalf of Buzz.</p>
		<img alt="Ava donates to AMF" src="/static/Avadonates.png" style="width:414px;height:302px;">
		<p>Buzz donates 5000 USD to Good Food Institute on behalf of Ava.</p>
		<img alt="Buzz donates to GFI" src="/static/Buzzdonates.png" style="width:414px;height:302px;">
		<p>Ava and Buzz share their donation receipts.</p>
		<p>Depending on Buzz's preferences, his remainng 1000 USD could be matched with another donor, or he could choose to donate it to AMF.</p>
		<p>Both Ava and Buzz get their tax credit at the end of the financial year! Knowing this, Ava might choose to donate more than she would have otherwise. </p>

		<h2 id="tocProcess">The process</h2>

		<h3>Fill out the form</h3>
		<p>On the form you will be asked for</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your country</li>
			<li>The charity you wish to support</li>
			<li>How much you want to donate</li>
			<li>The number of swaps you would be open to making. Choose one if you only want to swap once, and we will try to get a donor to swap your total amount. If you choose two or more swaps we may pair you with two or more donors to add up to your total swap amount.</li>
			<li>The last date for you to be matched. If you do not get matched by this date you will be notified and your information will be taken off the system. You can then either relist, or donate independently.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Please only fill in the form when you have the funds available to make the donation.</p>

		<h3>Matching check</h3>
		<p>If there is a compatible donor already in the system you will get an email notifying you within a couple of days. If there isn’t a compatible donor you will be emailed when a compatible donor adds their details to the website and you are matched to them.</p>
		<p>The email will tell you the charity your match wants to support, and the dollar amount (in your currency), and will contain a button to accept or reject that swap (you will have 72 hours to decide, otherwise the swap will be rejected automatically).</p>
		<p>If you and your match both accept the swap you will be sent an email containing</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Details of the matched donor</li>
			<li>Charity to donate to</li>
			<li>Amount to donate</li>
			<li>Instructions on how to donate</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If the match is for a smaller amount than your total donation, you will also be asked if you want to offer the remaining money back into the donation swap system.</p>

		<h3>Personal contact</h3>
		<p>Email your match to say hi and confirm the swap. This is to give you both the opportunity to make sure you both feel comfortable with the donation. Don’t donate until you have heard directly from your matched donor.</p>

		<h3>Donate and confirm</h3>
		<p>Your email will tell you how to go about donating, and how and when to get evidence of your donation (usually an email from the charity, but it might be a screenshot of your donation page).</p>
		<p>Once you receive confirmation your money was received by the charity, forward the confirmation to your match.</p>

		<h3>Follow up</h3>
		<p>A month after you are matched you will be emailed a very short form from <a href="/">donationswap@eahub.org</a> so you can let us know whether your swap happened, and any feedback you have.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>If at any step of the process you find a mistake, or have a suggestion to improve the system, please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="tocCountries">Countries and charities</h2>

		<p>For this BETA version we have limited our charities to most of those featured on the websites of <a href="https://www.givewell.org/" target="_blank">GiveWell</a>, <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/" target="_blank">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, <a href="https://ea-foundation.org/" target="_blank">Effective Altruism Foundation</a>, <a href="https://rcforward.org/" target="_blank">RC Forward</a> and <a href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/" target="_blank">The Life You Can Save</a>. We plan to expand the list gradually. We have limited the countries to the countries where the at least two of our charities is tax deductible (or one charity if that charity is AMF), and have omitted donation options where the fees are high or the method of donating is complex. If you would like another EA charity, or another country, to be added to the list please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>. To view which charities are tax-deductible in which countries, check out <a href="/charities/">our table of countries and charities.</a></p>

		<h2 id="tocPrivacy">Privacy</h2>
		<p>The EA donation swap database is only viewable by the EA donation swap team. Your name and email address will only be revealed once you and your matched donor agree to proceed with the swap. If you wish to delete or view your data please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>. After three months information from completed or expired offers will be anonymised in our database.</p>

		<h2 id="tocTechnical">Technical details</h2>

		<h3>Recurring donations</h3>
		<p>The EA donation swap scheme does not yet support recurring donations, but we hope to set this up in the future. In the meantime you can put in a swap request each time you wish to donate.</p>
		
		<h3>Languages</h3>
		<p>Our system is currently only in English. We hope to support more languages in the future.</p>

		<h3 id="tocGiftaid">Government contributions for UK and Irish donors</h3>
		<p>In most countries the government incentivises donations to registered charities by offering tax credits at the end of the financial year. The UK and Ireland are exceptions:</p>
		<h4>UK:</h4>
		<p>In the UK the government incentivises donations partially by adding 25% to each donation (Gift Aid), and partially via tax credits. So if a UK taxpayer donates £1000, £1250 goes to the charity. The swaps are arranged so that equal amounts go to both charities, so UK donors will be donating a smaller amount than their donation swapping partners will. The non-UK donor will usually get more money back as tax credits than the UK donor will. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/gift-aid" target="_blank">Read more about GiftAid.</a></p>
		<h4>Ireland:</h4>
		<p>In Ireland the government incentivises donations by adding 45% to each donation. So if an Irish tax payer donates €1000, €1450 goes to the charity.The swaps are arranged so that equal amounts go to both charities, so Irish donors will be donating a smaller amount than their donation swapping partners will. The non-Irish donor will usually get more money back as tax credits than the Irish donor will.<a href="https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/charities-and-sports-bodies/charitable-donation-scheme/index.aspx" target="_blank">Read more about the Irish government contribution.</a></p>

		<h3>Donation minimum</h3>
		<h4>General:</h4>
		<p>We have set the minimum amount for a swap to be €50, as this is the minimum amount that can be donated to a charity through the Effective Altruism Foundation. Having this minimum makes our algorithm simpler!</p>
		<h4>Ireland:</h4>
		<p>For the charity to claim the additional 45%, the donor must donate €250 or more to the charity over the financial year. As a result we have set the minimum donation for Irish taxpayers to be €250.</p>
		<h4>Norway:</h4>
		<p>For Norwegian donors to receive tax benefits, they must donate at least 500 kr to that particular charity over the financial year. As a result we have set the minimum donation for Norwegian taxpayers to be 500 kr. Norwegian donors can only receive tax benefits for donations up to 40,000 kr, so we  have made the maximum donation at this amount. Norwegian donors may have to keep a count of their donations so they don’t trade above this amount.</p>

		<h3>Tax rates</h3>
		<p>We have chosen to calculate the swaps so that both charities get the same amount of money, so that each charity would get the amount they would be getting if all charities were tax-deductible everywhere. This means we don’t need to know everyone’s tax rates. Donors are responsible for working out how much tax they will get back, and applying for the tax credit.</p>
		
		<h3>Donation matching campaigns</h3>
		<p>Many charities have donation matching campaigns, where your donation may be doubled if you donate at a particular time of year. The EA donation swap system currently doesn't take into account of these matches, as it is <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/15/why-you-shouldnt-let-donation-matching-affect-your-giving/" target="_blank">sometimes hard to tell if the matching funds will be going to the charity with or without your donation</a>. Please just enter the amount of money YOU will be donating. However, if your favourite charity is offering matching you may wish to choose your donation swap offer end date to take advantage of the matching campaign.</p>

		<h3>Bank or credit card costs</h3>
		<p>For simplicity we ignore transfer costs when calculating the amount to donate. We encourage people to donate using the method recommended by each charity.</p>

		<h3>Currencies</h3>
		<p>The EA donation scheme calculates the donation in the local currency of the donor. We currently cannot support cryptocurrency, but we intend to add this to the system in the future.

		<h2 id="tocDisclaimers">Disclaimers</h2>
		<p>We believe this donation swap system abides by tax laws, although we haven’t looked into the charity tax laws in all countries that may use this system. There is a possibility that if the tax office in your country finds out you used the donation swap system they will not grant you your tax credit, however we think this is very unlikely. </p>
		<p>The EA donation swap system is a matchmaking site, and works on a trust system. Once you are matched you will be given your matched donor’s name and email address, and we encourage you to correspond with them in order to feel comfortable about making the donation. We cannot guarantee that your matched donor will go through with their donation. If a donor fails to donate after both parties agreed to proceed, that donor will asked not to use the EA donation swap system in the future. We intend to add the ability to blacklist email addresses.</p>
		
		<h2 id="tocFuture">Future Improvements</h2>
		<p>We plan to add additional features to the system if donors will find the features useful</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Supporting recurring donations.</li>
			<li>Supporting more charities, languages and countries.</li>
			<li>Support cryptocurrency donations. </li>
			<li>Supporting swaps when tax deductibility is only available for one party. This could be useful if a person from a country with tax deductible charities wishes to donate to a person or organisation that is not tax-deductible anywhere. This donor could be matched with a donor from a country with no tax-deductible EA charities.  </li>
			<li>Taking into account the fees involved in donating. </li>
			<li>Improving the matching algorithm to increase the number of swap offers that get matched by their due date.  </li>
			<li>Potentially the calculation could take into account the donor’s tax rates to maximise tax deductions, or to provide a different swapping algorithm where both donors are out of pocket by the same amount. </li>
		</ul>
